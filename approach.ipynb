Data were considered from 11 clinical trials of 9vHPV, 4vHPV, and/or 2vHPV in adults aged 27 through 45 years, along with supplemental bridging immunogenicity data. In per-protocol analyses from three trials, 4vHPV and 2vHPV demonstrated significant efficacy against a combined endpoint of persistent vaccine-type HPV infections, anogenital warts, and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1 (low-grade lesions) or worse. In nine trials, seroconversion rates to vaccine-type HPV after 3 doses of any HPV vaccine were 93.6%–100% at 7 months after the first dose. Overall evidence on benefits was GRADE evidence level 2, for moderate-quality evidence. In nine trials, few serious adverse events and no vaccine-related deaths were reported. Overall evidence on harms was also GRADE evidence level 2, for moderate-quality evidence. In the efficacy trial that was the basis for 9vHPV licensure for adults through age 45 years, per-protocol efficacy of 4vHPV among women aged 24 through 45 years was 88.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 78.1–94.8), and intention-to-treat efficacy was 47.2% (95% CI = 33.5–58.2) against a combined endpoint of persistent infections, extragenital lesions, and CIN 1+ related to HPV types 6, 11, 16, or 18 (9).\\n\\nHPV burden of disease and impact of the vaccination program in the United States. Approximately 33,700 cancers are caused by HPV in the United States each year, including 12,900 oropharyngeal cancers among men and women, 10,800 cervical cancers among women, and 6,000 anal cancers among men and women; vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers are less common (10). HPV vaccination for adolescents has been routinely recommended for females since 2006 and for males since 2011 (1). The existing HPV vaccination program for adolescents has the potential to prevent the majority of these cancers. Mean age at acquisition of causal HPV infection for cancers is unknown, but is estimated to be decades before cancer is diagnosed. In 2017, coverage with ≥1 dose of HPV vaccine was 65.5% among adolescents aged 13 through 17 years (11). Although coverage with the recommended number of doses remains below the Healthy People 2020 target of 80% for adolescents (12), the U.S. HPV vaccination program has resulted in significant declines in prevalences of vaccine-type HPV infections, anogenital warts, and cervical precancers (13). For example, prevalences of 4vHPV vaccine-type infection during 2013–2016, compared with those of the prevaccine era, declined from 11.5% to 1.8% among females aged 14 through 19 years and from 18.5% to 5.3% among females aged 20 through 24 years (14). In addition, declines have been observed among unvaccinated persons, suggesting protective herd effects (15).\\n\\nHealth economic analyses. Five health economic models of HPV vaccination in the United States were reviewed (16). The cost effectiveness ratio for the current HPV vaccination program ranged from cost-saving to approximately $35,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (16). In the context of the existing vaccination program, the incremental cost per QALY for expanding male vaccination through age 26 years was $178,000 in a subset of analyses in one of the five models reviewed using more favorable model assumptions for adult vaccination (16). In the context of the existing program, expanding vaccination to adults through age 45 years would produce relatively small additional health benefits and less favorable cost-effectiveness ratios. The incremental cost per QALY for also vaccinating adults through age 30 or 45 years exceeded $300,000 in four of five models (16). Variation in results across models was likely due to uncertainties about HPV natural history, such as prevalence of immunity after clearance of natural infections, and level of herd protection from the existing program. Under the existing program, in a subset of analyses in one of the five models reviewed using more favorable model assumptions for adult vaccination, the number needed to vaccinate (NNV) to prevent one case of anogenital warts, CIN grade 2 or worse (high-grade lesions), or cancer would be 9, 22, and 202, respectively. For expanding recommendations for males through age 26 years to harmonize catch-up vaccination across genders, these NNV would be 40, 450, and 3,260, respectively. For expanding recommendations to include adults through age 45 years, these NNV would be 120, 800, and 6,500, respectively (16).\\n',\n","  '\\nSummary of Key Findings\\n'),\n"," (0.12351088882937944,\n","  '\\n9-valent HPV vaccine (9vHPV) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on December 10, 2014. This vaccine targets HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18, the types targeted by the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), as well as five additional types, HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58. ACIP reviewed results of a randomized trial among approximately 14,000 females aged 16 through 26 years that showed noninferior immunogenicity for the types shared by 4vHPV and 9vHPV and high efficacy for the five additional types. Other trials in the 9vHPV clinical development program included studies that compared antibody responses across age groups and females and males and concomitant vaccination studies. The evidence supporting 9vHPV vaccination was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework and determined to be type 2 (moderate level of evidence) among females and 3 (low level of evidence) among males; the recommendation was designated as a Category A recommendation (recommendation for all persons in an age- or risk-factor–based group).\\n',\n","  '\\nEvaluation of Efficacy of HPV Vaccines\\n'),\n"," (0.10522580670201265,\n","  \"\\nTwo HPV vaccines are licensed for use in the United States (10,11) (Table 3). Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil, produced by Merck and Co, Inc., Whitehouse Station, New Jersey) is licensed for use in females and males aged 9 through 26 years. Bivalent HPV vaccine (Cervarix, produced by GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) is licensed for use in females aged 9 through 25 years. Both vaccines are composed of type-specific HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein using recombinant DNA technology produces VLPs. The vaccines are noninfectious.\\n\\nQuadrivalent vaccine (HPV4) contains HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 L1 VLPs. The L1 protein is expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) and self-assembles into conformationally intact, noninfectious VLPs.

In the 9vHPV clinical trial that was the basis for FDA approval of a 2-dose series, participants were girls and boys aged 9 through 14 years, compared with young females aged 16 through 26 years (4). Among 1,377 participants, ≥97.9% seroconverted to all nine vaccine-preventable HPV types by 4 weeks after the last dose. For girls and boys who received 2 doses of 9vHPV 6 months apart (0, 6 month schedule) or 12 months apart (0, 12 month schedule), noninferiority criteria were met for seroconversion and GMTs. Furthermore, GMTs were significantly higher for all 9vHPV types among persons aged 9 through 14 years who received 2 doses compared with females aged 16–26 years who received 3 doses (0, 2, 6 month schedule). Six additional studies found similar results for 4vHPV and 2vHPV (6). Immunogenicity was found to be noninferior with 2 doses in persons aged 9 through 14 years compared with 3 doses in a group in which clinical efficacy was demonstrated (GRADE evidence type 3).\\n\\nEfficacy and effectiveness. Although efficacy and postlicensure effectiveness studies were reviewed, none met the inclusion criteria detailed above. The prelicensure HPV vaccine efficacy trials were conducted with 3-dose series; post hoc analyses conducted with data from some of these trials found high efficacy against infection among vaccinees who received 2 doses and those who received 3 doses (9,10). A large study comparing 2 doses with 3 doses also suggested similar efficacy against infection (11). Postlicensure effectiveness studies have found lower effectiveness against various HPV-associated outcomes among vaccinees who received 2 doses compared with those who received 3 doses, but methodologic challenges with these studies limit interpretation of the findings.**\\n\\nDuration of protection. Through 10 years of follow-up from clinical trials, no evidence of waning protection after a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine has been found (1). Because antibody kinetics are similar with 2-dose and 3-dose series, duration of protection is also expected to be long-lasting after a 2-dose series (12,13).\\n\\nHealth impact and cost-effectiveness modeling. Population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 2-dose and 3-dose schedules of 9vHPV in the United States have been modeled (14). Assuming both efficacy and duration of protection are similar with either schedule, a 2-dose series would be cost-saving and have similar population impact to a 3-dose series. Even if duration of protection is 20 years for a 2-dose series and lifelong for a 3-dose series, additional benefits of a 3-dose series would be relatively small, and a 2-dose series would be more cost-effective (14).\\n',\n","  '\\nLaboratory Testing for HPV\\n'),\n"," (0.035580670502582734,\n","  '\\nChildren and adults aged 9 through 26 years.

The second question requires the model to know historical changes to the vaccine. One way to achieve this is by time-stamping every statement/document as the date of being published, and passing the documents as such to the model, but this is against the spirit of the problem, and it will cause the model to overfit on the data we have.\n","\n","\n","The way the model is taught deeper insights about the information source is through **language modelling**. The model predicts the next token through a part of a sentence that learns about the data. This is done only on the data source we have. It teaches the model about the data and also it avoids the need for labelled data which is necessary for question answering.\n","\n","One thing to note is that due to the size of the model, VRAM limited the training that could be done. The maximum possible was for 10 epochs, and even then the results produced were a stark improvement. It is possible that with better compute, even better results can be produced by the model. But this may not be ideal for every new dataset, and hence 10 epochs is a good estimate for a fast trained model.\n","\n","A seperate notebook has been included that can do the finetuning.
